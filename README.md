Introduction
	This assignment is a supervised machine learning project of Dr. Eamonn Keogh’s Introduction to AI course at the University of California, Riverside during the quarter of Fall 2019. This report will compare three “wrapping” methods in their ability to select class-related features to serve as part of models to identify whether a new unseen observation is of class 1 or 2. The criteria the Forward Selection method and the Backward Elimination method will follow are completeness and optimality. The criteria the third original wrapper method will focus on is time complexity. My programming language of choice was Python (version 3).
